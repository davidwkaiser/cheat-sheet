# cheat-sheet
a Repo to hold a variety of cheat sheets

When learning human languages, I would group vocabulary by themes, i.e.  
"money," "food," "politics," "weather," etc.  

Since programming languages are just another form of language,  
and methods and functions are just another form of vocabulary,  
I am doing the same in order to increase my recall and understanding of  
necessary items

I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp, I'm looking for my first dev job.   
I know Ruby / Rails, JavaScript / jQuery / AJAX,  
HTML / CSS, and SQL. I've used Ionic (Angular for mobile), but   
don't remember much about it. I'm teaching myself Node.JS and  
Angular 2. 

I'm a leader, I'm responsible, and I'm low drama.
